"""
Add a dedicated ISSN protein recommendations chunk to both BM25 corpus and ChromaDB.

The ISSN References section consistently outranks the Conclusion section because
the references list contains dense protein/exercise/resistance terminology that both
BM25 and the cross-encoder score highly — but it contains no actual recommendations.

This chunk leads with the 1.6–2.2 g/kg answer so the reranker cannot miss it.

Run once:

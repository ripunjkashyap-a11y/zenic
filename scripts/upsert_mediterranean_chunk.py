    "Compared to the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern, the Mediterranean-Style pattern "
    "includes:\n"
    "- More fruits (2.5 cup equivalents/day vs 2 cup eq/day)\n"
    "- More seafood (15 oz equivalents/week vs 8 oz eq/week) — fish such as salmon, sardines, "
    "trout, herring, and other seafood are emphasized\n"
    "- Less dairy (2 cup equivalents/day vs 3 cup eq/day)\n"
    "- Similar vegetables (2.5 cup equivalents/day), emphasizing dark-green, red and orange, "
    "beans, peas, and lentils\n"
    "- Oils including olive oil (27 grams/day)\n"
    "- Whole grains (at least half of 6 oz eq/day)\n"
    "- Nuts, seeds, and legumes\n\n"
